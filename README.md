# Deep_Q-Learning-Model
Reinforcement Learning-Based Misbehavior Detection in V2X Networks  This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model for detecting misbehavior in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication networks. The model is trained to classify malicious and normal vehicles based on Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) using reinforcement learning (RL).
